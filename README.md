------------------------------- Street Uno Guide ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Uno is a card game best played with friends. Though there is an offical way to play the game, I have a slightly different way of playing the game.
The deviation lies in the special cards. In my version, the person playing the wild card is allowed to pick the color in play. 
Whereas, the official rule states that the next person to play gets to pick the color in play. Additionally, you are allowed to play the wild cards unconditionally during your turn. 

Things You Need-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. An official deck of Uno playing cards.
2. A flat playing surface (Table, floor, etc.)
3. One to 3 friends (including you)

Starting--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each Player starts with seven cards in hand.
Then the top card of the deck is layed face up on the playing surface.
A player starts and rotation begins clockwise.

Player Actions--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A player can do one of the following on their turn:
1. Play one card matching the discarded card in color number, or symbol.
2. Play a wild card, or a playable wild draw four card
3. Draw the top card from the deck, then play it if possible. If not, hold onto it.

Cards-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are 108 cards in a deck. The average card is a number ranging from 0 to 9. There are 4 colors (red, orange, green, and blue).
There are five different special cards in the deck:
1. Skip: When discarded, the next person's turn is skipped over.
2. Reverse: Switches the direction of the game. The player who played before the card was discarded is next. The player who discarded this card doesn't go again. In two player mode, the next player is skipped. 
3. Draw Two: Next player draws two cards and misses a turn.
4. Wild: The player who discards this card gets to pick any color.
5. Wild Draw Four: The player picks any color and the next player draws four cards and misses a turn.
Wild cards do not have an assigned color. They are allowed to be played on your turn whenever.
When faced by a draw four card, you are allowed to pass the penalty to the next player by also playing a draw four card. The penalty stacks and the vicitm must draw the total of the stacked penalties.
This rule also applies to the draw 2 card.

When the last card from the draw pile is drawn, the discarded pile minus the last card played is shuffled and becomes the draw pile.
The last card played begins the discard pile.
 
End Game/Objective----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The objective of the game is to discard all your cards before your opponents. This means you are not holding any cards. 
When you only have one card left, you are required to announce "UNO!" as a warning to the other players. 
If you don't announce UNO between laying down the second to last card and the next player's turn, they must draw two cards.
If someone falsely calls UNO, they must draw two cards.
